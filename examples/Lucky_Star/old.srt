Okay, let's do this!

0:00:05,88 --> 0:00:06,88
Let's go!

4
0:00:06,88 --> 0:00:07,52
Grr!

5
0:00:07,52 --> 0:00:09,40
Quit screwing around and start!

0:00:09,40 --> 0:00:12,40
{\i1}The ambiguous 3cm?
Does that mean it's plushy? Wait!{\i0}

0:00:12,40 --> 0:00:15,57

it's not an act, pooh{\i0}

0:01:47,78 --> 0:01:50,57
Nothing less from Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}! Amazing!

39
0:01:51,06 --> 0:01:52,91
You're so good at sports.

40
0:01:52,91 --> 0:01:55,48
Why don't you join any
of the athletic teams?

41
0:01:55,48 --> 0:01:57,72
Because if I join any of the teams,

42
0:01:58,10 --> 0:02:00,97
I won't be able to watch any of
the prime-time anime shows.

43
0:02:00,97 --> 0:02:04,01
"The Girl Who Dashes Off"

44
0:02:10,70 --> 0:02:14,17
Hey, Tsukasa, which end of
a choco-cornet do you eat first?

45
0:02:15,64 --> 0:02:17,03
From the head end first, right?

46
0:02:17,50 --> 0:02:18,55
I see...

47
0:02:19,48 --> 0:02:21,71
By the way, which end is the head?

48
0:02:21,71 --> 0:02:23,70
The fatter end, or the thinner end?

49
0:02:24,45 --> 0:02:28,06
I think this end,
the thin side, is the head.

50
0:02:28,06 --> 0:02:32,04
I see... I thought that
the fatter end was the head.

51
0:02:32,72 --> 0:02:34,80
So, why is the thinner end the head?

52
0:02:34,80 --> 0:02:37,13
I mean, doesn't this look
like a type of seashell?

53
0:02:37,13 --> 0:02:39,45
Why do you think it's
the fatter end, Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}?

54
0:02:39,45 --> 0:02:42,01
'Cause it looks like a caterpillar.

55
0:02:42,29 --> 0:02:43,34
A caterpillar?

56
0:02:43,34 --> 0:02:47,06
Well, but when you think about it,
the seashell gives a better image.

57
0:03:02,62 --> 0:03:03,87
Um...

58
0:03:04,74 --> 0:03:06,54
You can also tear the thin end off,

59
0:03:06,54 --> 0:03:09,83
and dip it in the extra chocolate
cream on the fatter end.

60
0:03:10,29 --> 0:03:12,12
I get it!

61
0:03:15,40 --> 0:03:18,30
Nothing less from Miyuki-{\i1}san{\i0}!
You're so smart!

62
0:03:18,30 --> 0:03:21,63
No... Each person has their
own way of eating, so...

63
0:03:21,63 --> 0:03:23,80
How do you eat a cream puff?

64
0:03:24,44 --> 0:03:26,22
A cream puff?

65
0:03:26,22 --> 0:03:28,48
Let's see... I start off by

66
0:03:28,48 --> 0:03:30,52
splitting it into two, taking the lid,

67
0:03:30,52 --> 0:03:32,97
and dipping it into
the cream in the pot area.

68
0:03:32,97 --> 0:03:36,70
Then, after that, I start
eating the pot area.

69
0:03:36,70 --> 0:03:40,08
That way, no cream spurts out,

70
0:03:40,08 --> 0:03:43,32
and I can eat both the pastry and
the cream in a balanced way.

71
0:03:44,98 --> 0:03:48,68
There are some that have both
custard and whipped cream, right?

72
0:03:48,68 --> 0:03:51,45
How do you eat those?
Do you mix them?

73
0:03:51,45 --> 0:03:54,72
No, I don't go out of my way
to mix the two.

74
0:03:54,72 --> 0:03:56,76
Wait, how exactly would you
mix them together?

75
0:03:56,76 --> 0:03:58,52
No, I was just asking.

76
0:03:58,52 --> 0:04:01,42
When do you eat the strawberry
on top of a strawberry shortcake,

77
0:04:01,42 --> 0:04:02,97
or the chestnut on top
of a Mont Blanc?

78
0:04:02,97 --> 0:04:04,52
Let's see...

79
0:04:04,52 --> 0:04:07,05
That depends on the amount
of strawberries

80
0:04:07,05 --> 0:04:09,23
that are sandwiched between
the two layers of sponge cake.

81
0:04:09,23 --> 0:04:12,12
I try to think about the pace
at which I eat the strawberries,

82
0:04:12,12 --> 0:04:14,69
the whipped cream,
and the sponge cake.

83
0:04:15,17 --> 0:04:19,76
So the timing in which I eat the
strawberry on top always differs.

84
0:04:19,76 --> 0:04:21,73
That's well thought out.

85
0:04:21,73 --> 0:04:25,32
I always save it for last,

86
0:04:25,32 --> 0:04:29,12
but sometimes, I get so full
that I can't eat it after all,

87
0:04:29,12 --> 0:04:31,40
or someone in my family
takes it away from me.

88
0:04:31,40 --> 0:04:34,36
You have to eat your favorite
food at the beginning, after all.

89
0:04:34,36 --> 0:04:36,36
Come to think of it,
I don't think I've ever seen

90
0:04:36,36 --> 0:04:38,59
my big sister having her
strawberry taken from her.

91
0:04:38,59 --> 0:04:40,59
That's Kagami for you.
Doesn't leave herself open.

92
0:04:40,59 --> 0:04:44,94
Can you eat the last bite
on a popsicle without dropping it?

93
0:04:44,94 --> 0:04:46,34
Does it drop?

94
0:04:46,34 --> 0:04:48,31
When you don't eat it right...

95
0:04:49,94 --> 0:04:51,52
It drops off, doesn't it?

96
0:04:51,52 --> 0:04:52,51
Yes.

97
0:04:52,51 --> 0:04:53,98
How do you go about it, Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}?

98
0:04:53,98 --> 0:04:55,46
I lick it up to the end.

99
0:04:55,46 --> 0:04:56,46
Wow...

100
0:04:56,46 --> 0:04:59,42
Why not keep turning it around
while you eat, like this?

101
0:04:59,42 --> 0:05:00,88
Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

102
0:05:00,88 --> 0:05:04,04
I'm not really one for
soft-serve ice cream.

103
0:05:04,04 --> 0:05:05,24
Why not?

104
0:05:06,32 --> 0:05:09,28
I dislike being left with
just the cone in the end.

105
0:05:09,28 --> 0:05:12,83
Right, right! You always have
just the cone left in the end!

106
0:05:12,83 --> 0:05:14,91
I always try to push the ice cream

107
0:05:14,91 --> 0:05:17,50
further and further
into the cone as I eat.

108
0:05:18,15 --> 0:05:20,27
How do you push it down?

109
0:05:20,27 --> 0:05:22,97
As I eat, like, with a push and shove.

110
0:05:22,97 --> 0:05:25,13
A push and shove, is it...

111
0:05:25,13 --> 0:05:27,42
Yuki-{\i1}chan{\i0}, you're always concerned
about balance, aren't you?

112
0:05:27,42 --> 0:05:28,52
I suppose so.

113
0:05:28,52 --> 0:05:30,62
Then how do you eat curried rice?

114
0:05:30,62 --> 0:05:32,47
Do you mix the curry roux
with the rice when you eat?

115
0:05:32,47 --> 0:05:35,13
No, I don't mix the two,

116
0:05:35,13 --> 0:05:36,98
but I always try to have
an equal amount left.

117
0:05:36,98 --> 0:05:38,84
I mix them up.

118
0:05:38,84 --> 0:05:39,73
What about you, Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}?

119
0:05:39,73 --> 0:05:41,28
It depends on the curry.

120
0:05:41,28 --> 0:05:43,58
When I pour on some sauce,
or drop a raw egg on it,

121
0:05:43,58 --> 0:05:45,24
I tend to mix it up, I guess.

122
0:05:45,24 --> 0:05:46,78
Sauce? On curry?

123
0:05:46,78 --> 0:05:48,11
Yeah. It's tasty.

124
0:05:48,11 --> 0:05:50,35
Do you use sauce on fried eggs too?

125
0:05:50,35 --> 0:05:52,70
No, it's soy sauce for fried eggs.

126
0:05:52,70 --> 0:05:55,25
I see... I use mayonnaise.

127
0:05:55,25 --> 0:05:58,25
On fried eggs? Not hard-boiled eggs?

128
0:05:58,25 --> 0:06:02,32
Yeah. Mayonnaise goes well
with basically every egg dish.

129
0:06:02,32 --> 0:06:03,46
You put it on curry too?

130
0:06:03,74 --> 0:06:04,93
Yeah.

131
0:06:04,93 --> 0:06:08,01
Of course, I do on plain white rice too,
but also on beef bowls.

132
0:06:08,01 --> 0:06:09,92
It goes well with that sweet broth.

133
0:06:09,92 --> 0:06:11,22
It's also good on
chicken and egg bowls.

134
0:06:11,53 --> 0:06:14,08
You know how egg and chicken
are child and parent, right?

135
0:06:14,08 --> 0:06:17,47
So, I put some mayonnaise
that's made from eggs on it,

136
0:06:17,47 --> 0:06:20,47
and call it the Relative Bowl.

137
0:06:21,58 --> 0:06:23,98
That, and I used to hate {\i1}natto {\i0}beans,

138
0:06:23,98 --> 0:06:26,09
but I can eat them when
I put mayonnaise on them.

139
0:06:26,09 --> 0:06:27,71
Ew, I can't even imagine that.

140
0:06:27,71 --> 0:06:29,92
Oh, but the tastiest thing must be

141
0:06:29,92 --> 0:06:33,20
when you put mayonnaise
on soft-boiled eggs.

142
0:06:33,20 --> 0:06:35,75
In our house, even
the fried eggs are half cooked.

143
0:06:36,37 --> 0:06:38,79
That's how my dad likes it.

144
0:06:38,79 --> 0:06:42,20
I guess he likes sucking on the yolk.

145
0:06:42,20 --> 0:06:45,75
So if you fry the yolk too much,
he can't suck it out anymore.

146
0:06:46,12 --> 0:06:48,01
How do you eat chicken skewers?

147
0:06:48,01 --> 0:06:49,16
What do you mean, how?

148
0:06:49,16 --> 0:06:50,84
Do you eat it right off the skewer?

149
0:06:50,84 --> 0:06:53,04
Or do you take the meat off
the skewer with chopsticks?

150
0:06:53,04 --> 0:06:54,52
Let's see.

151
0:06:54,52 --> 0:06:56,65
When I eat the entire
skewer by myself,

152
0:06:56,65 --> 0:06:57,61
I'll eat it as is,

153
0:06:57,61 --> 0:07:00,14
but when I'm eating in a crowd,
I separate it from the skewer.

154
0:07:00,14 --> 0:07:04,03
Oh, yeah, don't you feel awkward
when one last morsel is left?

155
0:07:04,03 --> 0:07:07,15
Yes. The very last piece is very
difficult to put your hands on.

156
0:07:07,15 --> 0:07:10,03
And with nobody eating it,
time passes,

157
0:07:11,16 --> 0:07:14,44
and it gets all dry and obviously
not so tasty looking,

158
0:07:14,44 --> 0:07:16,25
and nobody really wants it anymore.

159
0:07:16,25 --> 0:07:18,19
But when the server tries
to take the plate away,

160
0:07:18,19 --> 0:07:20,62
you say, "Oh, we're still
eating that," and stuff.

161
0:07:21,01 --> 0:07:23,79
And yet, we sometimes go home
without eating it after all.

162
0:07:23,79 --> 0:07:25,36
It's such a waste.

163
0:07:25,36 --> 0:07:27,56
I feel sorry for it...

164
0:07:27,56 --> 0:07:29,56
Oh, you know, I also feel sorry for

165
0:07:29,56 --> 0:07:31,48
that one piece of meat
that's left on the grill

166
0:07:31,48 --> 0:07:33,18
and turns into charcoal when
you go for Korean barbecue.

167
0:07:33,18 --> 0:07:34,30
Well, with Korean barbecue,

168
0:07:34,30 --> 0:07:36,70
you're always eating and
chatting at the same time,

169
0:07:36,70 --> 0:07:38,35
so you end up pretty busy.

170
0:07:38,35 --> 0:07:40,49
Salted beef tongue with green
onions roasts really quickly,

171
0:07:40,49 --> 0:07:42,10
so it's especially hurried.

172
0:07:42,10 --> 0:07:46,61
You're right. It's already done
by the time you flip it over once.

173
0:07:47,04 --> 0:07:48,36
You flip it over?

174
0:07:49,03 --> 0:07:50,11
Salted tongue with green onions?

175
0:07:50,11 --> 0:07:50,61
Yeah.

176
0:07:50,61 --> 0:07:53,11
You shouldn't flip those over!

177
0:07:53,37 --> 0:07:54,62
Is that so?

178
0:07:54,62 --> 0:07:56,25
I mean, when you flip it over,

179
0:07:56,25 --> 0:07:58,60
all the green onions on top
fall into the grill!

180
0:07:58,60 --> 0:08:00,08
Oh, you're right.

181
0:08:00,08 --> 0:08:01,77
You don't need to flip it over.

182
0:08:01,77 --> 0:08:02,81
You just roast one side,

183
0:08:02,81 --> 0:08:04,83
and enough heat is distributed
over the meat naturally.

184
0:08:04,83 --> 0:08:07,64
I see. I'll do that from now on.

185
0:08:07,64 --> 0:08:10,03
You absolutely, positively
shouldn't flip it over.

186
0:08:10,03 --> 0:08:11,16
Is that so?

187
0:08:11,16 --> 0:08:12,10
Yeah.

188
0:08:12,10 --> 0:08:13,54
No kidding...

189
0:08:16,26 --> 0:08:18,24
Anyway, the fatter end
and the thinner end,

190
0:08:18,24 --> 0:08:20,31
which end is the head
of a choco-cornet?

191
0:08:21,30 --> 0:08:23,35
A mega bad boy!

192
0:08:23,35 --> 0:08:26,14
There sure are a lot of
confinement crimes lately.

193
0:08:26,14 --> 0:08:30,07
Like, having a girl call you
"Master" and stuff.

194
0:08:30,72 --> 0:08:32,73
You know, isn't that more
because of guys playing

195
0:08:32,73 --> 0:08:36,06
too many dating sims and erotic games,
rather than just moral degeneration?

196
0:08:36,06 --> 0:08:37,49
That's a really common situation.

197
0:08:37,49 --> 0:08:40,23
You're really talking about yourself!

198
0:08:41,76 --> 0:08:44,91
Wait a second. Why do you know
what goes on in those adult games?

199
0:08:44,91 --> 0:08:46,42
You're in eleventh grade, right?

200
0:08:47,00 --> 0:08:48,55
{\i1}Lucky Star{\i0}!

201
0:08:49,42 --> 0:08:51,13
"First Trimester Midterm Results"
"3rd: Miyuki Takara"

202
0:08:51,50 --> 0:08:55,26
You're amazing, always
at the top of your class.

203
0:08:55,63 --> 0:08:58,41
Miyuki-{\i1}san{\i0}, do you have
any faults at all?

204
0:08:58,41 --> 0:09:00,99
I am embarrassed to say,
but sometimes,

205
0:09:00,99 --> 0:09:04,56
I tend to think things out too much,
or just plain space out.

206
0:09:04,86 --> 0:09:07,94
--Sometimes I slice my finger 
using a vegetable slicer,

207
0:09:07,20 --> 0:09:07,94
--Ouch!

208
0:09:07,94 --> 0:09:11,60
or trip over my own feet and fall down,

209
0:09:11,60 --> 0:09:15,18
or get one end of my tote bag
caught in the train door.

210
0:09:16,20 --> 0:09:20,56
Miyuki-{\i1}san{\i0}, you don't call those faults.
You call them "{\i1}moe {\i0}points."

211
0:09:20,56 --> 0:09:21,96
{\i1}Moe{\i0}?

212
0:09:21,96 --> 0:09:23,08
Clumsiness is your element?

213
0:09:23,08 --> 0:09:26,37
What kind of images are running in
your head right now, Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}?!

214
0:09:26,72 --> 0:09:29,76
Miyuki-{\i1}san{\i0}, you're attractive enough.
Why do you wear glasses?

215
0:09:29,76 --> 0:09:32,00
You can only target a certain breed
of people like that, you know?

216
0:09:32,00 --> 0:09:33,13
Target?

217
0:09:33,48 --> 0:09:35,92
Putting aside whether
she's popular with guys,

218
0:09:35,92 --> 0:09:37,55
why don't you switch to contacts?

219
0:09:37,55 --> 0:09:40,28
I hear that eyeglasses tend
to make your vision worse.

220
0:09:40,28 --> 0:09:43,97
Well, it's embarrasing to say now
that we're in high school and all,

221
0:09:44,55 --> 0:09:47,07
but, well, I...

222
0:09:47,07 --> 0:09:49,93
I'm afraid of contact lenses!

223
0:09:49,93 --> 0:09:53,55
Or rather, I'm scared of
putting anything into my eyes.

224
0:09:53,55 --> 0:09:56,24
I can't even open
my eyes underwater.

225
0:09:56,24 --> 0:09:59,70
Damn, she's really cute.
A natural airhead...

226
0:10:00,13 --> 0:10:02,31
Oh, isn't that Miyuki-{\i1}san{\i0}?

227
0:10:02,70 --> 0:10:07,37
"Yoshimizu Optometrist"

228
0:10:03,46 --> 0:10:06,65
Maybe she came to get
an eye exam for contacts?

229
0:10:09,20 --> 0:10:12,41
Maybe Miyuki-{\i1}san {\i0}is better
off like that forever.

230
0:10:12,41 --> 0:10:13,61
That looks painful...

231
0:10:13,61 --> 0:10:15,13
She's a living national monument.

232
0:10:17,57 --> 0:10:19,64
Kagami's sick at home
with a cold today?

233
0:10:19,64 --> 0:10:23,45
Yeah. At least it doesn't seem
like she's got the flu.

234
0:10:23,45 --> 0:10:27,34
I'm an idiot, so I have no worries
about catching the flu and stuff.

235
0:10:27,96 --> 0:10:29,61
I hear that about a cold often enough,

236
0:10:29,61 --> 0:10:31,86
but that works for the flu too?

237
0:10:34,04 --> 0:10:36,28
Colds and the flu are different things?

238
0:10:36,28 --> 0:10:38,56
I thought the flu was just
the deluxe version of a cold.

239
0:10:38,56 --> 0:10:41,15
I think it's different...

240
0:10:41,15 --> 0:10:44,58
But when you ask me like that,
I'm not really so sure myself anymore.

241
0:10:45,25 --> 0:10:47,58
The difference between
influenza and a cold?

242
0:10:47,58 --> 0:10:48,85
Yup, yup.

243
0:10:48,85 --> 0:10:50,29
Well, let's see.

244
0:10:50,56 --> 0:10:53,04
Influenza is viral,

245
0:10:53,04 --> 0:10:56,33
and has many full-body symptoms
such as fever and muscle aches,

246
0:10:56,33 --> 0:10:59,18
and furthermore can
have complications.

247
0:10:59,18 --> 0:11:00,48
On the other hand, a cold is mainly

248
0:11:00,48 --> 0:11:02,60
inflammation of the throat
and a runny nose,

249
0:11:02,60 --> 0:11:04,67
and your fever doesn't
end up that high.

250
0:11:04,67 --> 0:11:07,31
The detailed symptoms
are different as well.

251
0:11:07,75 --> 0:11:08,80
Hmm...

252
0:11:08,80 --> 0:11:12,10
So these two are different illnesses.

253
0:11:12,61 --> 0:11:13,69
Really...

254
0:11:14,82 --> 0:11:15,90
B-But...

255
0:11:16,16 --> 0:11:18,73
Well, there are a lot of
common aspects as well,

256
0:11:18,73 --> 0:11:22,46
so you could still say the flu
is a scaled-up model of a cold.

257
0:11:22,46 --> 0:11:23,49
I see!

258
0:11:25,58 --> 0:11:28,57
Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}, what's with that
serious look on your face?

259
0:11:28,57 --> 0:11:30,57
Well, it's nothing big,

260
0:11:30,57 --> 0:11:32,64
but something's been on my mind
about this morning's conversation.

261
0:11:32,64 --> 0:11:34,79
You mean about the cold and the flu?

262
0:11:34,79 --> 0:11:38,75
Tsukasa, you didn't deny it even once
when I said I was an idiot.

263
0:11:38,75 --> 0:11:40,67
It's not like that!
That's not what I meant...

264
0:11:46,22 --> 0:11:48,28
Oh, welcome, Konata.

265
0:11:48,28 --> 0:11:50,49
She came by to visit Sis.

266
0:11:50,49 --> 0:11:52,70
Oh, thank you for
coming all the way out.

267
0:11:52,70 --> 0:11:55,08
No problem. Excuse me!

268
0:11:58,76 --> 0:12:02,32
Heh, Kagami's face is unexpectedly
cute when she's asleep.

269
0:12:02,32 --> 0:12:05,12
--What?! What are you doing here?! Go home!

270
0:12:03,12 --> 0:12:05,12
--Oh, she's up, she's awake.

271
0:12:05,68 --> 0:12:08,79
A visit? You? All the way
out here just for me?

272
0:12:09,10 --> 0:12:10,04
That's right.

273
0:12:10,04 --> 0:12:12,20
But I'd feel bad if you
caught what I have,

274
0:12:12,20 --> 0:12:13,79
so I'll just take the sentiments.

275
0:12:14,12 --> 0:12:16,65
What's with this? It makes me happy.

276
0:12:16,65 --> 0:12:21,08
A new type of virus is going around,
so she's worried about me?

277
0:12:21,08 --> 0:12:25,00
I thought that the only things she
thinks about were games and anime.

278
0:12:25,00 --> 0:12:27,05
I'm kind of touched now.

279
0:12:28,43 --> 0:12:31,88
Well, I'd like to copy that
homework we got the other day.

280
0:12:31,88 --> 0:12:33,79
That, and you showed me
a really cute sleeping face,

281
0:12:33,79 --> 0:12:35,15
so don't worry about it.

282
0:12:35,15 --> 0:12:35,73
Go home!

283
0:12:37,24 --> 0:12:41,47
Kagami, Miyuki is here to visit you!

284
0:12:41,47 --> 0:12:42,40
Okay...

285
0:12:42,78 --> 0:12:43,90
Excuse me.

286
0:12:44,19 --> 0:12:46,43
Oh, I'm sorry to trouble you
on a holiday.

287
0:12:46,43 --> 0:12:48,73
Is it all right for you to be up?

288
0:12:48,73 --> 0:12:49,91
--I brought this as a get-well gift.

289
0:12:49,12 --> 0:12:49,91
--Thanks!

290
0:12:49,91 --> 0:12:51,82
I'm almost completely well.

291
0:12:51,82 --> 0:12:53,71
I took some medicine,
so my fever is down too.

292
0:12:53,71 --> 0:12:54,70
Here.

293
0:12:54,70 --> 0:12:56,97
Flowers and fruit! I'm so happy!

294
0:12:56,97 --> 0:12:58,27
Oh, do sit down.

295
0:12:58,27 --> 0:13:00,01
Thank you so much.

296
0:13:00,01 --> 0:13:03,79
I had thought of visiting
right away with Izumi-{\i1}san{\i0},

297
0:13:03,79 --> 0:13:06,51
but I couldn't find the time
to do so yesterday...

298
0:13:06,51 --> 0:13:07,68
It's all right, it's fine.

299
0:13:07,68 --> 0:13:11,24
I was entrusted with the
committee meeting minutes.

300
0:13:11,24 --> 0:13:13,02
Oh, thank you!

301
0:13:13,02 --> 0:13:15,40
If you can take a look at it,

302
0:13:15,40 --> 0:13:17,32
though not so much as to
worsen your condition...

303
0:13:17,32 --> 0:13:18,12
Sure.

304
0:13:18,12 --> 0:13:21,50
That, and these are the budget
requests for each club...

305
0:13:21,50 --> 0:13:25,12
And what else did I have... Let's see...

306
0:13:25,12 --> 0:13:29,37
Oh, if you're not feeling well
right now, I'll go home now.

307
0:13:29,37 --> 0:13:31,95
This is what a visit
really should be like!

308
0:13:31,95 --> 0:13:33,75
Had something happened?

309
0:13:33,75 --> 0:13:36,41
Actually, Konata came by yesterday...

310
0:13:37,75 --> 0:13:39,50
Oh, brother.

311
0:13:39,50 --> 0:13:43,46
Perhaps that was Izumi-{\i1}san{\i0}'s way
of caring for you?

312
0:13:43,96 --> 0:13:46,27
About the homework, perhaps
she was goofing around

313
0:13:46,27 --> 0:13:49,53
in an effort to cheer
you up, Kagami-{\i1}san{\i0}.

314
0:13:49,53 --> 0:13:53,37
And your sleeping face might
have been an inevitable result

315
0:13:53,37 --> 0:13:55,23
of trying not to make noise.

316
0:13:55,23 --> 0:13:57,44
Is this girl a saint or something?!

317
0:13:57,44 --> 0:13:59,23
I can't think of it that way at all!

318
0:13:59,23 --> 0:14:03,23
Come to think of it,
is Tsukasa-{\i1}san {\i0}out today?

319
0:14:03,23 --> 0:14:05,76
Morning...

320
0:14:05,76 --> 0:14:09,41
Sis, are you feeling any better?

321
0:14:12,37 --> 0:14:16,54
See for yourself. She lives
a more relaxed life than the ill.

322
0:14:17,32 --> 0:14:20,40
Well, I'm not always like this.

323
0:14:20,40 --> 0:14:23,44
Today, it's like that "One sleeps
late in the spring" thing.

324
0:14:23,44 --> 0:14:25,38
Oh, it's a little late to
say this, but welcome.

325
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:27,36
I know how that is.

326
0:14:27,36 --> 0:14:30,01
I have trouble waking up
in the morning myself lately.

327
0:14:30,01 --> 0:14:33,26
Isn't that it? I'm so sleepy lately...

328
0:14:33,26 --> 0:14:36,86
That's true. It's especially
warm out today.

329
0:14:36,86 --> 0:14:38,38
Yeah, yeah. Like that.

330
0:14:38,38 --> 0:14:39,73
You can't help it.

331
0:14:40,01 --> 0:14:42,59
The holiday we had the other day
was really warm too, right?

332
0:14:42,59 --> 0:14:43,47
Yes.

333
0:14:43,47 --> 0:14:46,30
When I woke up, it was already dusk.

334
0:14:46,30 --> 0:14:48,57
I spent most of the day asleep.

335
0:14:48,57 --> 0:14:51,31
It's better to rest when you can.

336
0:14:51,31 --> 0:14:54,48
In the end, I spent that
entire day in my pajamas.

337
0:14:54,48 --> 0:14:56,12
Oh, I guess the same goes for today.

338
0:14:57,04 --> 0:14:59,88
Is what you have on
right now your pajamas?

339
0:14:59,88 --> 0:15:01,18
Yeah, it is.

340
0:15:01,18 --> 0:15:04,51
That is very cute! They don't
look like pajamas at all!

341
0:15:04,51 --> 0:15:05,44
Really?

342
0:15:05,44 --> 0:15:06,24
Yes.

343
0:15:06,24 --> 0:15:08,19
Is it all right for me
to stay in this outfit?

344
0:15:08,19 --> 0:15:10,43
Yes. I think you could walk
around outside like that.

345
0:15:10,43 --> 0:15:12,51
--Maybe I can head to the
convenience store like this?

346
0:15:10,86 --> 0:15:14,14
--Man, it's an endless 
wait for the punch line...

347
0:15:12,51 --> 0:15:14,14
--Yes, I think it would 
probably be all right...

348
0:15:14,14 --> 0:15:18,10
"Nurse's Office"

349
0:15:15,89 --> 0:15:18,10
A slight increase...

350
0:15:18,64 --> 0:15:20,43
No, that's not it!

351
0:15:20,43 --> 0:15:23,45
The bra I'm wearing today has
underwires and a large pad in it,

352
0:15:23,45 --> 0:15:25,05
so I'm heavier by that much!

353
0:15:25,05 --> 0:15:28,12
Right, that's it. I wonder
how much it is in grams.

354
0:15:28,12 --> 0:15:29,61
If I can subtract that much...

355
0:15:32,37 --> 0:15:33,84
It's over...

356
0:15:33,84 --> 0:15:35,58
I screwed up!

357
0:15:35,58 --> 0:15:37,53
I forgot that the
physical exam was today,

358
0:15:37,53 --> 0:15:40,08
so I wore character-print
underwear today!

359
0:15:40,08 --> 0:15:42,12
I'm so embarrassed!

360
0:15:42,12 --> 0:15:44,96
"Nurse's Office"

361
0:15:43,19 --> 0:15:44,96
I haven't grown!

362
0:15:44,96 --> 0:15:46,13
"Nurse's Office"

363
0:15:46,13 --> 0:15:49,34
Dammit! Why are you
the only one looking confident?!

364
0:15:49,66 --> 0:15:51,61
S'up? I'm here.

365
0:15:51,61 --> 0:15:52,68
Oh, Sis.

366
0:15:53,02 --> 0:15:54,93
Just a thought...

367
0:15:54,93 --> 0:15:57,64
Kagami, you come here
to hang out a lot.

368
0:15:57,64 --> 0:15:59,56
Don't you have friends in your class?

369
0:15:59,56 --> 0:16:01,29
Don't put me in the same boat as you.

370
0:16:01,29 --> 0:16:02,59
Are you picking a fight with me?

371
0:16:02,59 --> 0:16:04,96
What, I thought that you were
shunned by your classmates.

372
0:16:04,96 --> 0:16:06,03
Before you worry about others,

373
0:16:06,03 --> 0:16:08,53
why don't you worry about yourself?
You have zero social skills!

374
0:16:08,53 --> 0:16:10,89
I have no worries about that.

375
0:16:10,89 --> 0:16:13,72
I may look like this, but I have
about a hundred friends,

376
0:16:13,72 --> 0:16:17,07
and my social and bargaining
skills are pretty high,

377
0:16:17,07 --> 0:16:19,54
and I join a party every night.

378
0:16:19,54 --> 0:16:22,35
With my allies, I work to bring
back the glimmer in crystals

379
0:16:22,35 --> 0:16:24,48
to prevent the world
from falling to ruin,

380
0:16:24,48 --> 0:16:25,54
and rescue the kidnapped princess--

381
0:16:25,54 --> 0:16:27,39
Wait, you're talking about a game!

382
0:16:27,39 --> 0:16:29,63
I haven't seen that guy
around for a while...

383
0:16:29,63 --> 0:16:30,36
Who?

384
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:32,59
She's talking about one of
her game buddies, I'm sure.

385
0:16:32,59 --> 0:16:35,23
Yeah. He was
a soldier-type character,

386
0:16:35,23 --> 0:16:36,86
but he wanted to raise
his combat skills,

387
0:16:36,86 --> 0:16:39,16
and he left saying
he was going to train

388
0:16:39,16 --> 0:16:41,48
in an area with a lot of monsters...

389
0:16:42,71 --> 0:16:44,38
And he hasn't come back since.

390
0:16:44,38 --> 0:16:46,99
I heard he's camping out
in the underground nest.

391
0:16:46,99 --> 0:16:49,88
But I wonder if he's all right,
acting all hermit-like.

392
0:16:49,88 --> 0:16:51,74
Everyone's getting pretty worried.

393
0:16:51,74 --> 0:16:53,36
A hermit inside a game?

394
0:16:53,36 --> 0:16:57,25
I don't know the details,
but from the login info,

395
0:16:57,25 --> 0:16:59,31
it looks like he's been
playing the game nonstop.

396
0:16:59,31 --> 0:17:01,34
A hermit, both in real life
and in virtual life!

397
0:17:01,34 --> 0:17:03,58
Well, it's the same guy doing it, so...

398
0:17:03,88 --> 0:17:07,83
By the way, how did you two get to
know each other, Tsukasa, Konata?

399
0:17:08,20 --> 0:17:12,78
Tsukasa was about to be taken away
by some suspicious big foreign guy,

400
0:17:12,78 --> 0:17:15,07
and just then I arrived on the scene
in the nick of time!

401
0:17:15,07 --> 0:17:18,04
And I used my strong moves, the
front punch and the whirlwind kick,

402
0:17:18,04 --> 0:17:20,20
ever so gracefully to rescue her!

403
0:17:20,20 --> 0:17:22,91
Why does she end up talking about
games in every conversation?

404
0:17:22,91 --> 0:17:26,64
Well, actually, I just showed
my skills as a martial artist.

405
0:17:26,64 --> 0:17:28,86
I don't approve of
starting off with violence,

406
0:17:28,86 --> 0:17:30,07
but that's one of your
good points, I guess.

407
0:17:30,07 --> 0:17:32,91
Actually, the foreigner was
just asking for directions,

408
0:17:32,91 --> 0:17:35,08
but I didn't understand
what he was saying at all,

409
0:17:35,08 --> 0:17:37,07
and was troubled when
Kona-{\i1}chan {\i0}came by...

410
0:17:37,07 --> 0:17:38,44
Wait, that's no good at all!

411
0:17:38,44 --> 0:17:40,08
Why are you acting like
you won the battle?!

412
0:17:40,40 --> 0:17:43,79
The time has finally come again...

413
0:17:43,79 --> 0:17:45,45
Is something going on?

414
0:17:45,45 --> 0:17:48,25
Well, pro baseball season has started.

415
0:17:48,25 --> 0:17:51,93
Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}, you don't like
watching sports and stuff?

416
0:17:51,93 --> 0:17:53,77
You seem to be good
with anything athletic.

417
0:17:53,77 --> 0:17:55,72
I thought you'd be the type that
would like watching that stuff.

418
0:17:55,72 --> 0:17:58,59
But when extra innings delay
all the following programs,

419
0:17:58,59 --> 0:18:01,72
it throws off the recording times
for all the late-night anime,

420
0:18:02,03 --> 0:18:05,56
and at worst, the broadcast
itself gets cancelled.

421
0:18:05,56 --> 0:18:08,64
It sucks to have something
you like disappear.

422
0:18:08,64 --> 0:18:10,24
Kagami, when do you
eat the strawberry

423
0:18:10,24 --> 0:18:11,63
on top of a strawberry shortcake?

424
0:18:11,63 --> 0:18:12,57
Why?

425
0:18:12,57 --> 0:18:13,92
I was wondering if you were the type

426
0:18:13,92 --> 0:18:15,85
that saves your favorites
until the end.

427
0:18:15,85 --> 0:18:18,57
It's true that I eat
my favorite stuff last,

428
0:18:18,57 --> 0:18:20,68
but when it comes to
strawberries, it depends.

429
0:18:20,68 --> 0:18:23,20
Then do you roast both sides of
salted tongue with green onions?

430
0:18:23,20 --> 0:18:24,55
Salted tongue with green onions?

431
0:18:25,52 --> 0:18:27,24
They roast very quickly to begin with,

432
0:18:27,24 --> 0:18:29,37
but when you roast both sides,
it gets done even faster.

433
0:18:29,37 --> 0:18:31,63
You shouldn't!
The green onions will fall off.

434
0:18:31,63 --> 0:18:34,41
I thought you put the green onions
on top after the meat's all roasted!

435
0:18:34,41 --> 0:18:36,51
If you do that, the green onions
don't get roasted at all.

436
0:18:36,51 --> 0:18:39,61
Aren't the green onions acting
as a condiment in the first place?

437
0:18:39,61 --> 0:18:41,48
You don't get it at all...

438
0:18:41,48 --> 0:18:43,68
Well, maybe both ways are all right.

439
0:18:44,48 --> 0:18:46,22
Which side of a choco-cornet
do you think is the head,

440
0:18:46,22 --> 0:18:48,57
the fatter end, or the thinner end?

441
0:18:49,62 --> 0:18:50,72
The fatter end?

442
0:18:50,72 --> 0:18:52,27
You're agreeing with me.

443
0:18:52,27 --> 0:18:53,11
Seriously?

444
0:18:53,48 --> 0:18:55,07
Then which end do you eat first?

445
0:18:55,84 --> 0:18:57,37
Aren't you supposed to
tear off the thinner end,

446
0:18:57,37 --> 0:18:59,32
and dip it in the leftover chocolate
cream in the fatter end?

447
0:19:00,23 --> 0:19:01,32
Really...

448
0:19:01,64 --> 0:19:02,54
Yeah.

449
0:19:07,25 --> 0:19:11,37
Have you ever made friends
in real life other than us?

450
0:19:12,26 --> 0:19:16,17
I used to have a really good friend
back in junior high.

451
0:19:16,17 --> 0:19:18,54
Oh, you actually had one.

452
0:19:18,54 --> 0:19:21,12
I haven't contacted her in a while...

453
0:19:21,12 --> 0:19:23,05
I wonder what she's
been up to lately.

454
0:19:25,57 --> 0:19:28,36
She had written in the junior
high graduation literature book

455
0:19:28,36 --> 0:19:30,17
that her dream was
to become a Mage...

456
0:19:30,17 --> 0:19:31,39
In the end, birds of a feather
are flocking together?!

457
0:19:32,10 --> 0:19:33,54
{\i1}Lucky Star{\i0}!

458
0:19:34,40 --> 0:19:36,77
{\i1}Lucky Channel{\i0}!

459
0:19:37,06 --> 0:19:38,40
Morning Luckies!

460
0:19:38,40 --> 0:19:41,56
Now {\i1}Lucky Channel {\i0}has finally begun!

461
0:19:41,56 --> 0:19:44,27
We're on TV now! All right!

462
0:19:44,27 --> 0:19:46,48
Hello to all the people seeing me
for the first time on TV!

463
0:19:46,48 --> 0:19:48,91
I'm Akira Kogami, your navigator!

464
0:19:48,91 --> 0:19:50,66
Oh... and I'm Shiraishi.

465
0:19:52,58 --> 0:19:53,37
Who?

466
0:19:53,37 --> 0:19:54,70
A joke! Just kidding!

467
0:19:54,70 --> 0:19:58,97
This is Minoru Shiraishi-{\i1}san{\i0}, who
will be helping me out from now on!

468
0:19:58,97 --> 0:20:00,35
Ta-da-da-da!

469
0:20:00,35 --> 0:20:02,81
Oh, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi,

470
0:20:02,81 --> 0:20:05,58
and I will be the assistant
for Akira-{\i1}sama{\i0}...

471
0:20:05,58 --> 0:20:06,48
Nice to see you.

472
0:20:06,48 --> 0:20:09,22
Oh? You're a bit tense, Shiraishi-{\i1}san{\i0}?

473
0:20:09,22 --> 0:20:12,00
Come on, you're finally on TV now,

474
0:20:12,00 --> 0:20:14,22
loosen up a bit more! Just kidding!

475
0:20:14,22 --> 0:20:15,92
I'm sorry, I'm just not used to this.

476
0:20:15,92 --> 0:20:18,49
Now, I know this is early,
but we already have

477
0:20:18,49 --> 0:20:20,36
letters of congratulation
from our viewers!

478
0:20:20,36 --> 0:20:22,11
Oh, yes... well...

479
0:20:22,11 --> 0:20:24,86
A letter from "I Love Berry-Kou" in Osaka.

480
0:20:25,30 --> 0:20:28,32
Congratulations on the TV
debut of {\i1}Lucky Channel{\i0}!

481
0:20:28,32 --> 0:20:29,12
That's a thank you!

482
0:20:29,12 --> 0:20:31,72
By the way, I have
a question for Akira.

483
0:20:31,72 --> 0:20:34,81
Akira, you're recognized as
a super-idol by yourself and others,

484
0:20:34,81 --> 0:20:36,97
but how much money
does an idol earn?

485
0:20:36,97 --> 0:20:38,13
Please tell me.

486
0:20:41,59 --> 0:20:42,50
How much money?

487
0:20:42,50 --> 0:20:43,34
Yes.

488
0:20:44,07 --> 0:20:46,84
Kind of a personal question here.

489
0:20:46,84 --> 0:20:50,85
You know... What's the point of
asking me something like that?

490
0:20:50,85 --> 0:20:52,16
Akira-{\i1}sama{\i0}?

491
0:20:52,16 --> 0:20:54,48
Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.

492
0:20:54,48 --> 0:20:55,90
Honestly, it really depends.

493
0:20:55,90 --> 0:20:57,69
There are some events
that are really cheap,

494
0:20:57,69 --> 0:21:00,52
but since I'm still getting a set
amount from my production company,

495
0:21:00,52 --> 0:21:03,32
I don't know how much they're
deducting for company profit at all.

496
0:21:03,32 --> 0:21:05,98
On top of that, I've been in this
business since I was three,

497
0:21:05,98 --> 0:21:08,70
so all my earnings still get deposited
into my parents' bank account.

498
0:21:08,70 --> 0:21:13,58
I only get a small allowance
from them. And it's really small.

499
0:21:13,58 --> 0:21:14,54
Hey, come to think of it,

500
0:21:14,54 --> 0:21:17,26
Mama's been buying pricey
brand-name bags left and right lately.

501
0:21:17,26 --> 0:21:19,54
Maybe that was the money
I earned from this TV show?

502
0:21:19,54 --> 0:21:21,34
You're freakin' kidding me!

503
0:21:21,34 --> 0:21:23,12
--Am I Cinderella or something?!

504
0:21:22,20 --> 0:21:23,12
--Wait a minute!

505
0:21:23,12 --> 0:21:25,71
--Just because Dad stopped sending living 
expenses ever since they got separated,

506
0:21:24,87 --> 0:21:27,89
--Well, uh, you really don't need 
to go that far in describing...

507
0:21:25,71 --> 0:21:27,89
--she shouldn't be totally 
relying on me for money!

508
0:21:28,90 --> 0:21:31,98
Oh, no, it's time for us
to say goodbye!

509
0:21:31,98 --> 0:21:33,63
Akira's so lonely!

510
0:21:33,63 --> 0:21:35,39
And so, in this segment,

511
0:21:35,39 --> 0:21:37,56
please send all sorts of
questions and praise to me,

512
0:21:37,56 --> 0:21:41,07
as well as opinions you have
about the show as a whole!

513
0:21:41,07 --> 0:21:43,32
A word from you as well,
Shiraishi-{\i1}san{\i0}, please!

514
0:21:43,32 --> 0:21:46,62
Oh... then, I hope you will see us
again in the next episode.

515
0:21:46,62 --> 0:21:48,03
See ya!

516
0:21:49,12 --> 0:21:52,20
That's right... Are you serious about
getting a part in the main show?

517
0:21:52,20 --> 0:21:54,37
Oh, where did you hear about that?

518
0:21:56,05 --> 0:21:58,70
Going to karaoke with
four people is unusual.

519
0:21:58,70 --> 0:22:01,85
I hardly ever come to places like this.

520
0:22:01,85 --> 0:22:05,36
Come on, we only have two hours,
so all of you, sing up a ton!

521
0:22:05,36 --> 0:22:07,02
You don't have to be so enthusiastic.

522
0:22:07,02 --> 0:22:08,24
We have plenty of time!

523
0:22:08,24 --> 0:22:10,68
You know, this makes my heart race.

524
0:22:10,68 --> 0:22:12,40
It's so much fun.

525
0:22:12,40 --> 0:22:14,32
And when you sing, you end up
with such a clear conscience...

526
0:22:14,32 --> 0:22:15,56
Hey, where's the catalog?

527
0:22:15,56 --> 0:22:16,43
Catalog?

528
0:22:16,43 --> 0:22:17,61
Yeah, the catalog.

529
0:22:17,61 --> 0:22:18,80
The catalog?

530
0:22:18,80 --> 0:22:21,04
You know, the one that
lists all the song numbers.

531
0:22:21,04 --> 0:22:22,73
Oh, you mean this? Here.

532
0:22:22,73 --> 0:22:24,35
Then I'll go first!

533
0:22:24,35 --> 0:22:27,56
That was fast... Wait, you already
entered three songs?!

534
0:22:27,56 --> 0:22:30,15
It's such a waste of time if you
don't put in tons of songs!

535
0:22:31,35 --> 0:22:32,64
Test, test, test.

536
0:22:32,64 --> 0:22:34,48
What song is this?

537
0:22:34,48 --> 0:22:37,13
{\i1}Space Iron-Men Kyoudain{\i0}!

538
0:22:37,13 --> 0:22:39,20
You just have to start off
with this one!

539
0:22:39,20 --> 0:22:40,68
I don't know this one...

540
0:22:40,68 --> 0:22:42,40
Go for it, Kona-{\i1}chan{\i0}!

541
0:22:42,40 --> 0:22:45,03
Konata, that's too loud!

542
0:22:45,80 --> 0:22:47,86
I'm telling you, turn down the volume!

543
0:22:49,28 --> 0:22:52,02
How the hell does she know a song like this?

544
0:23:25,38 --> 0:23:28,84
"Next Episode Preview"

545
0:23:26,20 --> 0:23:28,01
Now, what's with the next 
episode of {\i1}Lucky Star{\i0}?

546
0:23:28,40 --> 0:23:30,92
Konata here! Sleepy!

547
0:23:30,92 --> 0:23:33,42
Why is it that on the nights
that you slept so much,

548
0:23:33,42 --> 0:23:36,01
you're especially sleepy
in the morning?

549
0:23:36,01 --> 0:23:38,40
It kinda defeats the purpose
of getting a good night's sleep.

550
0:23:38,40 --> 0:23:41,26
