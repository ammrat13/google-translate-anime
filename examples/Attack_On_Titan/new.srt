Something else - I feel like I've been dreaming a

The wall was made by God

Because I'm here all day long apologize because I 
apologize Haruna kicking my throat dry

It happened that drinks were mixed in drinks

It's a trivial matter

0:06:12,03 --> 0:06:15,42

I'm doing well I am a doctor

If they can break the wall  the sky is definitely 
done

Such a thing never happened once in 100 years

It is the most dangerous time to feel at ease

0:06:32,05 --> 0:06:33,39
My father was saying that

0:06:33,85 --> 0:06:35,93

0:06:35,93 --> 0:06:37,04
Well certainly

The teacher made this town from a prevalent 
disease

0:06:42,43 --> 0:06:44,65
My head got up to the teacher

0:06:44,94 --> 0:06:47,92
It's different

0:06:49,30 --> 0:06:52,08
If you become an apprentice you can reinforce the 
wall

0:06:52,08 --> 0:06:55,35
I have a chance to see the roaring outside

0:06:55,90 --> 0:07:00,64

0:07:17,27 --> 0:07:18,87

What a soldier is doing is that it is the worst

It was better when we were stupid that we were 
unavailable

Even if you can not get out of the wall

You can live if you eat and sleep

About the Walls (1)
Humanity lives within three walls.
The outermost is Wall Maria.
The second, Wall Rose.
The innermost is Wall Sina.

About the Walls (2)
Distance between each is roughly the same.
100km separate Maria and Rose.
130km separate Rose and Sina.
From Sina to the center is about 250km.

Because it was peaceful for 100 years just by 
being in the wall

They are children who are interested in the 
outside world as a policy of the big government I 
probably made it
