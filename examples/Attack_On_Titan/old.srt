1
0:00:25,52 --> 0:00:29,25
That day, humanity remembered...

2
0:00:35,11 --> 0:00:38,18
the terror of being ruled by them.

3
0:00:40,59 --> 0:00:45,24
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.

4
0:01:03,85 --> 0:01:05,41
Prepare for combat!

5
0:01:06,23 --> 0:01:07,46
We have one target...

6
0:01:07,93 --> 0:01:11,89
Defeat it, and make this humanity's 
first base outside the walls.

7
0:01:13,01 --> 0:01:14,30
Target approaching!

8
0:01:19,65 --> 0:01:21,58
Split into five groups, just as we practiced!

9
0:01:22,70 --> 0:01:24,56
We'll be the decoys!

10
0:01:24,98 --> 0:01:27,35
Attack teams, switch to 
Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear!

11
0:01:49,47 --> 0:01:51,59
We'll strike from all directions at once!

12
0:01:57,16 --> 0:01:59,64
We'll show you the power

13
0:01:59,64 --> 0:02:00,93
of humanity!

14
0:03:34,98 --> 0:03:39,99
To You, 2,000 Years in the Future 
The Fall of Zhiganshina (1)

15
0:04:06,86 --> 0:04:09,15
Huh? Mikasa...

16
0:04:09,94 --> 0:04:11,43
Let's head back.

17
0:04:12,73 --> 0:04:14,85
What am I doing here?

18
0:04:16,20 --> 0:04:18,80
You're so out of it. 
Were you sound asleep?

19
0:04:19,15 --> 0:04:20,00
No...

20
0:04:20,55 --> 0:04:24,70
It's just, I feel like I had a really long dream.

21
0:04:26,78 --> 0:04:28,39
What was it about?

22
0:04:28,81 --> 0:04:30,38
I can't remember...

23
0:04:34,42 --> 0:04:36,67
Eren, why are you crying?

24
0:04:42,05 --> 0:04:44,59
{\fad(1,807)}The Year: 845 â€” Zhiganshina District

25
0:04:48,05 --> 0:04:49,00
Listen!

26
0:04:49,56 --> 0:04:52,35
These walls were constructed with God's wisdom!

27
0:04:52,76 --> 0:04:55,56
They were given to us by God himself!

28
0:04:56,31 --> 0:05:00,09
None may defile them!

29
0:05:02,92 --> 0:05:07,32
Don't tell anyone that I was crying.

30
0:05:07,32 --> 0:05:08,57
I won't...

31
0:05:09,36 --> 0:05:12,58
But if you're crying for no reason,

32
0:05:12,90 --> 0:05:15,08
why not have your dad check you over?

33
0:05:15,08 --> 0:05:16,54
No way!

34
0:05:16,89 --> 0:05:18,83
I can't tell my dad about it.

35
0:05:18,83 --> 0:05:20,96
What are you crying over, Eren?

36
0:05:22,88 --> 0:05:24,15
Hannes!

37
0:05:24,70 --> 0:05:26,72
Did Mikasa get mad at you for something?

38
0:05:27,96 --> 0:05:30,17
Why would that make me cry?

39
0:05:30,17 --> 0:05:31,58
And you stink of alcohol!

40
0:05:32,64 --> 0:05:34,28
Oh, come on...

41
0:05:35,72 --> 0:05:37,24
You're all drinking again?

42
0:05:37,24 --> 0:05:39,23
Why don't you join us?

43
0:05:39,23 --> 0:05:41,92
Um, but don't you have work?

44
0:05:41,92 --> 0:05:43,98
Yeah! We're guarding the gate today.

45
0:05:44,62 --> 0:05:49,58
We spend all day here, so eventually, 
we get hungry and thirsty.

46
0:05:49,91 --> 0:05:53,34
And the fact that some of what 
we drink may be alcohol...

47
0:05:53,34 --> 0:05:55,37
Well, that isn't too big a problem.

48
0:05:56,83 --> 0:05:59,21
Can you fight like that if you have to?

49
0:06:00,83 --> 0:06:02,35
If we have to? When would we...

50
0:06:02,35 --> 0:06:03,30
When else?!

51
0:06:03,82 --> 0:06:06,76
If they breached the walls 
and entered the city!

52
0:06:10,83 --> 0:06:12,03
Ow...

53
0:06:12,03 --> 0:06:15,42
Hey, Eren, don't yell like that...

54
0:06:16,60 --> 0:06:19,02
The doctor's son is pretty lively today.

55
0:06:19,65 --> 0:06:23,63
If they ever do breach 
the walls, we'll do our jobs.

56
0:06:23,93 --> 0:06:28,08
But that hasn't happened 
for a hundred years.

57
0:06:28,08 --> 0:06:32,05
But my dad says that you're in the most danger

58
0:06:32,05 --> 0:06:33,39
when you lower your guard!

59
0:06:33,85 --> 0:06:35,93
Doctor Jaeger, huh?

60
0:06:35,93 --> 0:06:37,04
Well, he's right...

61
0:06:37,62 --> 0:06:41,73
He once saved the whole city from an epidemic.

62
0:06:42,43 --> 0:06:44,65
We owe him more than we could ever repay.

63
0:06:44,94 --> 0:06:47,92
But that has nothing to do with them.

64
0:06:49,30 --> 0:06:52,08
As a soldier, when you go up to repair the walls,

65
0:06:52,08 --> 0:06:55,35
you can sometimes see them, 
wandering around outside.

66
0:06:55,90 --> 0:07:00,64
But this wall is fifty meters high. 
They can't do anything about it.

67
0:07:01,04 --> 0:07:02,27
Th-Then,

68
0:07:02,60 --> 0:07:05,90
you're actually not prepared to fight them?

69
0:07:05,90 --> 0:07:07,18
Nope.

70
0:07:08,17 --> 0:07:09,54
What?!

71
0:07:09,54 --> 0:07:13,88
Then stop calling yourselves the Garrison, 
and become the Wall Repair Corps!

72
0:07:13,88 --> 0:07:15,70
I wouldn't mind that...

73
0:07:17,27 --> 0:07:18,87
But listen, Eren...

74
0:07:18,87 --> 0:07:22,71
If we're fighting, 
it means things are bad.

75
0:07:23,24 --> 0:07:27,80
As long as everyone's laughing at us 
and calling us useless freeloaders,

76
0:07:27,80 --> 0:07:29,88
that means we're all safe.

77
0:07:32,83 --> 0:07:36,40
Even if we can never leave 
these walls for our entire lives,

78
0:07:37,02 --> 0:07:39,64
as long as we eat and sleep, we'll survive...

79
0:07:40,05 --> 0:07:42,57
But that makes us just like...

80
0:07:44,15 --> 0:07:46,19
Just like cattle!

81
0:07:49,43 --> 0:07:51,75
That's a brave kid you have there.

82
0:07:51,75 --> 0:07:54,92
Not like he could do anything 
about it, huh, Hannes?

83
0:07:55,42 --> 0:07:56,85
Y-Yeah.

84
0:07:58,71 --> 0:08:00,47
Hey, Eren!

85
0:08:01,82 --> 0:08:03,54
Strange kid.

86
0:08:04,47 --> 0:08:08,59
Does he want to join the Survey Corps?

87
0:08:17,81 --> 0:08:20,87
Eren, you should stop considering the Survey Corps.

88
0:08:22,06 --> 0:08:25,25
What? You're going to tell 
me they're stupid, too?

89
0:08:25,55 --> 0:08:28,16
That isn't it...

90
0:08:35,01 --> 0:08:37,24
The Survey Corps is back!

91
0:08:37,54 --> 0:08:39,20
The front gate's opening!

92
0:08:39,20 --> 0:08:40,25
Let's go, Mikasa!

93
0:08:40,25 --> 0:08:41,63
The heroes are back!

94
0:08:54,61 --> 0:08:56,64
Damn it, I can't see!

95
0:09:25,46 --> 0:09:27,69
These are all that made it back?

96
0:09:28,25 --> 0:09:30,09
Everyone else must've been eaten.

97
0:09:31,09 --> 0:09:34,20
That's what happens when 
you go outside the walls.

98
0:09:34,52 --> 0:09:37,09
Moses! Moses!

99
0:09:37,65 --> 0:09:41,44
Um, my son, Moses... I don't see him.

100
0:09:41,44 --> 0:09:43,47
Where is he?

101
0:09:44,81 --> 0:09:46,71
This is Moses's mother.

102
0:09:47,28 --> 0:09:48,29
Bring it.

103
0:10:14,29 --> 0:10:17,18
That is all we managed to retrieve.

104
0:10:33,98 --> 0:10:36,02
But my son...

105
0:10:36,02 --> 0:10:37,90
He helped, right?

106
0:10:39,91 --> 0:10:43,25
Even if he didn't do anything directly...

107
0:10:43,25 --> 0:10:45,04
My son's death helped humanity

108
0:10:45,38 --> 0:10:48,54
fight back, didn't it?!

109
0:10:55,13 --> 0:10:56,16
Of course!

110
0:11:00,12 --> 0:11:01,12
No.

111
0:11:02,37 --> 0:11:05,52
Our recon this time didn't...

112
0:11:05,87 --> 0:11:06,68
No,

113
0:11:07,10 --> 0:11:08,33
we never...

114
0:11:10,98 --> 0:11:14,67
Never learn a thing!

115
0:11:15,68 --> 0:11:17,69
It's my fault...

116
0:11:18,15 --> 0:11:20,37
My own incompetence killed our men!

117
0:11:21,08 --> 0:11:27,64
And we still don't even know what they are!

118
0:11:33,60 --> 0:11:35,23
What a mess...

119
0:11:35,23 --> 0:11:36,55
You've got that right.

120
0:11:37,12 --> 0:11:41,35
It's like our taxes all go to fatten them up.

121
0:11:44,74 --> 0:11:46,54
What are you doing, stupid brat?

122
0:11:49,00 --> 0:11:49,85
Hey!

123
0:11:49,85 --> 0:11:51,44
What are you doing, Mikasa?!

124
0:11:52,56 --> 0:11:53,98
Get back here!

125
0:11:55,88 --> 0:11:58,36
Mikasa, you can let go now!

126
0:12:03,86 --> 0:12:05,23
What was that for?

127
0:12:05,23 --> 0:12:07,10
The firewood spilled everywhere!

128
0:12:08,33 --> 0:12:09,37
Eren,

129
0:12:10,00 --> 0:12:13,21
do you still want to join the Survey Corps?

130
0:12:21,60 --> 0:12:23,78
Help me pick these up...

131
0:12:25,18 --> 0:12:26,87
There isn't enough to bother.

132
0:12:28,97 --> 0:12:32,98
Information We Can Share So Far: 

About the Walls (1) 
Humanity lives within three walls. 
The outermost is Wall Maria. 
The second, Wall Rose. 
The innermost is Wall Sina.

133
0:12:32,98 --> 0:12:36,98
Information We Can Share So Far: 

About the Walls (2) 
Distance between each is roughly the same. 
100km separate Maria and Rose. 
130km separate Rose and Sina. 
From Sina to the center is about 250km.

134
0:12:42,32 --> 0:12:43,45
Back.

135
0:12:45,24 --> 0:12:46,60
Welcome home.

136
0:12:49,95 --> 0:12:51,16
Oh, Eren!

137
0:12:51,16 --> 0:12:53,50
You actually worked hard for a change.

138
0:12:53,95 --> 0:12:55,21
Yeah...

139
0:12:58,57 --> 0:12:59,87
What?

140
0:12:59,87 --> 0:13:01,53
Your ears turned red.

141
0:13:01,53 --> 0:13:03,34
That means you're lying.

142
0:13:03,34 --> 0:13:05,59
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?

143
0:13:06,85 --> 0:13:09,32
Huh? Are you going somewhere, Dad?

144
0:13:09,96 --> 0:13:10,96
Work?

145
0:13:10,96 --> 0:13:13,58
Yes, I'm going inland to see patients.

146
0:13:13,58 --> 0:13:15,29
Probably for two or three days.

147
0:13:18,63 --> 0:13:21,61
Eren said he wants to join the Survey Corps.

148
0:13:26,24 --> 0:13:28,32
M-Mikasa, I told you not to tell them!

149
0:13:28,32 --> 0:13:28,99
Eren!

150
0:13:29,74 --> 0:13:31,37
What are you thinking?

151
0:13:31,67 --> 0:13:35,31
Do you know how many people 
have died outside the walls?

152
0:13:35,74 --> 0:13:36,96
I do!

153
0:13:36,96 --> 0:13:38,00
In that case...

154
0:13:38,00 --> 0:13:38,90
Eren...

155
0:13:40,72 --> 0:13:43,38
Why do you want to go outside?

156
0:13:44,92 --> 0:13:48,76
I want to know what it's like out there.

157
0:13:49,31 --> 0:13:53,13
I don't want to spend my life inside 
the walls, not knowing anything!

158
0:13:53,68 --> 0:13:54,77
Also...

159
0:13:55,57 --> 0:13:57,90
If no one carries on their work,

160
0:13:58,67 --> 0:14:01,40
all the casualties till now will have been in vain!

161
0:14:05,66 --> 0:14:06,86
I see.

162
0:14:08,66 --> 0:14:10,14
The ship is waiting.

163
0:14:10,14 --> 0:14:11,58
I'll be going now.

164
0:14:11,58 --> 0:14:13,05
Wait...

165
0:14:13,05 --> 0:14:14,45
You need to talk to Eren!

166
0:14:14,79 --> 0:14:18,02
Karla, human curiosity is not something

167
0:14:18,02 --> 0:14:20,89
you can restrain with a lecture.

168
0:14:21,54 --> 0:14:22,34
Eren...

169
0:14:23,90 --> 0:14:25,17
When I get back,

170
0:14:25,17 --> 0:14:28,84
I'll show you what I've kept secret 
in the basement all this time.

171
0:14:29,29 --> 0:14:31,26
R-Really?

172
0:14:35,05 --> 0:14:36,81
Bye!

173
0:14:39,01 --> 0:14:40,29
I won't let you.

174
0:14:41,62 --> 0:14:43,60
Joining the Survey Corps? 
Don't be stupid.

175
0:14:43,60 --> 0:14:45,65
Huh? Stupid?!

176
0:14:45,65 --> 0:14:48,76
I think people who're fine being cattle

177
0:14:48,76 --> 0:14:50,36
are way more stupid!

178
0:14:50,99 --> 0:14:51,85
Eren!

179
0:14:55,03 --> 0:14:56,12
Mikasa,

180
0:14:56,50 --> 0:14:58,82
sometimes he doesn't think things through.

181
0:14:59,27 --> 0:15:01,71
When you're in trouble, 
you must help one another.

182
0:15:02,34 --> 0:15:03,19
Okay.

183
0:15:06,33 --> 0:15:07,88
What's wrong, heretic?

184
0:15:09,25 --> 0:15:11,85
If you don't like it, hit back!

185
0:15:12,91 --> 0:15:14,81
No way.

186
0:15:14,81 --> 0:15:17,11
That would put me on your level!

187
0:15:17,11 --> 0:15:18,10
What?!

188
0:15:18,41 --> 0:15:21,39
You know what I said is true.

189
0:15:21,80 --> 0:15:24,27
That's why you're hitting me instead of arguing.

190
0:15:25,26 --> 0:15:28,42
Doesn't that mean you admit I win?

191
0:15:29,89 --> 0:15:32,08
Shut your damned mouth!

192
0:15:32,08 --> 0:15:33,56
Stop it!

193
0:15:35,28 --> 0:15:36,24
That's Eren!

194
0:15:36,94 --> 0:15:38,76
The fool's back.

195
0:15:38,76 --> 0:15:40,09
He wants to get his ass kicked?

196
0:15:40,09 --> 0:15:41,43
Let's give him what he wants!

197
0:15:42,91 --> 0:15:44,59
M-Mikasa's here, too!

198
0:15:45,41 --> 0:15:48,01
N-No... Let's get out of here!

199
0:15:53,48 --> 0:15:56,24
They ran away when they saw me!

200
0:15:56,24 --> 0:15:58,95
No, they ran when they saw Mikasa.

201
0:15:58,95 --> 0:15:59,86
Ouch...

202
0:16:00,47 --> 0:16:02,44
Hey, are you okay, Armin?

203
0:16:06,66 --> 0:16:08,36
I can stand on my own.

204
0:16:09,14 --> 0:16:10,32
All right.

205
0:16:13,36 --> 0:16:18,36
So I said that humanity should 
go out into the world someday.

206
0:16:18,36 --> 0:16:20,65
And they hit me and called me a heretic.

207
0:16:20,65 --> 0:16:21,71
Damn it.

208
0:16:23,80 --> 0:16:27,64
Why does everyone act like you're 
crazy if you want to go outside?

209
0:16:27,64 --> 0:16:32,79
Because staying within the walls has 
brought peace for a hundred years.

210
0:16:33,26 --> 0:16:38,10
They're afraid that if many of us 
venture out, we'll risk letting them in.

211
0:16:38,37 --> 0:16:43,98
So the royal government declared 
any interest in the outside world taboo.

212
0:16:44,59 --> 0:16:47,73
That's our lives we're risking, 
so it's our business!

213
0:16:48,05 --> 0:16:49,19
You can't.

214
0:16:51,42 --> 0:16:52,43
No.

215
0:16:52,78 --> 0:16:55,92
Come to think of it, why did you tell my parents?

216
0:16:56,85 --> 0:16:58,58
I don't remember ever saying I'd help.

217
0:16:58,58 --> 0:16:59,91
H-How did it go?

218
0:17:00,57 --> 0:17:03,58
Well... They weren't happy.

219
0:17:05,19 --> 0:17:06,42
I bet.

220
0:17:10,80 --> 0:17:11,67
But you're right.

221
0:17:12,39 --> 0:17:17,47
I wonder about those who think staying 
inside the walls will protect us forever.

222
0:17:17,47 --> 0:17:18,98
Mom!

223
0:17:21,33 --> 0:17:24,52
Just because the walls haven't 
been breached in a hundred years

224
0:17:25,08 --> 0:17:27,45
doesn't mean they won't be

225
0:17:29,28 --> 0:17:30,75
breached today...

226
0:17:50,51 --> 0:17:51,59
What?

227
0:17:51,59 --> 0:17:52,64
An explosion?

228
0:17:53,88 --> 0:17:54,67
Over there!

229
0:17:54,67 --> 0:17:56,13
I think something fell from the sky!

230
0:17:58,82 --> 0:18:00,07
Hey, Armin!

231
0:18:04,00 --> 0:18:05,18
What's wrong?

232
0:18:05,65 --> 0:18:07,52
What can you see?

233
0:18:17,60 --> 0:18:19,11
No way...

234
0:18:19,11 --> 0:18:20,62
That wall

235
0:18:21,28 --> 0:18:23,45
is fifty meters tall!

236
0:18:24,63 --> 0:18:25,95
It's one of them...

237
0:18:31,94 --> 0:18:33,25
A Titan!

238
0:19:19,79 --> 0:19:20,89
It broke...

239
0:19:21,83 --> 0:19:23,89
a hole in the wall...

240
0:19:28,84 --> 0:19:29,89
They're coming inside!

241
0:19:30,37 --> 0:19:32,65
The Titans are getting inside!

242
0:19:36,23 --> 0:19:37,42
We have to get out of here!

243
0:19:38,27 --> 0:19:38,90
Eren!

244
0:19:39,27 --> 0:19:40,65
My house is over there...

245
0:19:41,35 --> 0:19:42,41
My mom!

246
0:19:43,70 --> 0:19:44,66
Mikasa!

247
0:19:50,93 --> 0:19:52,54
It's all over...

248
0:19:53,30 --> 0:19:55,75
The Titans are going

249
0:19:56,94 --> 0:19:59,51
to take the city!

250
0:20:05,40 --> 0:20:07,00
Nothing hit my house!

251
0:20:07,47 --> 0:20:08,81
Once I turn that corner,

252
0:20:08,81 --> 0:20:10,73
my house will still be there!

253
0:20:15,34 --> 0:20:16,45
Mom!

254
0:20:19,04 --> 0:20:20,07
Mom!

255
0:20:22,19 --> 0:20:22,84
Eren...

256
0:20:22,84 --> 0:20:24,74
Mikasa, grab that side!

257
0:20:24,74 --> 0:20:26,09
We have to get this off her!

258
0:20:45,16 --> 0:20:46,43
Hurry, Mikasa!

259
0:20:46,43 --> 0:20:47,35
I know.

260
0:20:48,27 --> 0:20:50,79
The Titans are inside, aren't they?

261
0:20:51,65 --> 0:20:53,85
Eren, take Mikasa and run!

262
0:20:53,85 --> 0:20:55,07
Now!

263
0:20:55,52 --> 0:20:56,86
I want to run!

264
0:20:56,86 --> 0:20:58,97
So hurry and get out of there!

265
0:20:59,87 --> 0:21:02,82
My legs were crushed by the rubble.

266
0:21:03,71 --> 0:21:05,98
Even if I get out, I can't run.

267
0:21:07,26 --> 0:21:08,34
You understand, don't you?

268
0:21:08,34 --> 0:21:10,32
Then I'll carry you!

269
0:21:10,32 --> 0:21:12,66
Why do you never listen to me?!

270
0:21:13,60 --> 0:21:15,82
At least listen this one last time!

271
0:21:16,32 --> 0:21:17,50
Mikasa!

272
0:21:18,62 --> 0:21:19,81
No...

273
0:21:20,23 --> 0:21:21,12
No!

274
0:21:22,09 --> 0:21:24,05
If you don't go, all three of us will...

275
0:21:26,06 --> 0:21:26,90
Hannes!

276
0:21:29,36 --> 0:21:31,52
Take the children and run!

277
0:21:32,74 --> 0:21:35,08
Don't underestimate me, Karla.

278
0:21:35,57 --> 0:21:39,37
I'll defeat the Titan, and save you all!

279
0:21:40,12 --> 0:21:41,01
Wait!

280
0:21:41,01 --> 0:21:42,44
Don't try to fight it!

281
0:21:43,45 --> 0:21:44,29
She's right.

282
0:21:44,29 --> 0:21:46,11
If it were just the kids, I could save them.

283
0:21:46,11 --> 0:21:50,07
But I'm going to repay that family 
for what they've done for me!

284
0:22:06,58 --> 0:22:08,41
Wait, Hannes!

285
0:22:08,41 --> 0:22:10,26
What are you doing?!

286
0:22:11,42 --> 0:22:12,77
Thank you.

287
0:22:13,43 --> 0:22:15,52
My mom is still back there!

288
0:22:16,39 --> 0:22:18,44
Eren! Mikasa!

289
0:22:19,27 --> 0:22:21,39
You must survive!

290
0:22:34,17 --> 0:22:35,79
Don't go...

291
0:22:46,43 --> 0:22:49,93
Stop!

292
0:23:23,60 --> 0:23:27,00
That day, humanity remembered...

293
0:23:31,96 --> 0:23:34,76
{\i1}the terror of being ruled by them.

294
0:23:37,10 --> 0:23:41,80
{\i1}The humiliation of being kept in a cage.

295
0:23:53,95 --> 0:23:55,67
The Fall of Zhiganshina.

296
0:23:56,33 --> 0:24:00,83
All humanity could do 
was pray, scream, and die...

297
0:24:01,71 --> 0:24:03,33
Among them, Eren was

298
0:24:03,33 --> 0:24:06,55
the only one to swear revenge.

299
0:24:04,50 --> 0:24:06,96
That Day 
The Fall of Zhiganshina (2)
