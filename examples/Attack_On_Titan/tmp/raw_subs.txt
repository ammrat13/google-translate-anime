To me
Let's go home soon.
Why was this
I was sleepy until I got so sleepy

Something else - I feel like I've been dreaming a long time
What was it?
I can not remember
Ellen Why are you crying

The wall was made by God
In the work of God
Anyone

But it is unbelievable that tears come out
Once the uncle got to see it

It's the year when I broke the wall and came into the city

Do not suddenly remember me
I'm doing well I am a doctor
If they can break the wall  the sky is definitely done
Such a thing never happened once in 100 years
It is the most dangerous time to feel at ease
My father was saying that
I forgot to say
Well certainly
The teacher made this town from a prevalent disease
My head got up to the teacher
It's different
If you become an apprentice you can reinforce the wall
I have a chance to see the roaring outside
I do not think I can do this 50 M wall in my house
null
You do not have the preparedness to fight with them in the first place
Hey
null
Let's no longer give a garrison a garrison and let's eat all you can eat
That's bad  is not it?
Do it now.
What a soldier is doing is that it is the worst time
It was better when we were stupid that we were unavailable
Everyone can live peacefully
Even if you can not get out of the wall
You can live if you eat and sleep
But just as if
It's almost like a livestock
What a child is brave
You can do nothing  Erase none.

It's a sweet guy
Do you want to enter Honkawa nursery school
You had better stop Ellen survey team
What's making a fool of your survey team
It is such a problem that it makes a fool of me

Why do you want to go outside
I want to know What is going on with the outside world
I do not want to know anything and spend the whole time in the wall.

If there was no one with no one here
The lives of dead people will be in vain so far

I admit that what I said is correct
I could only do what I could do without it
Is not it that it was executed?

So when you say that humankind should go to the outside world
I wanted to be beaten up
null
I just want to go outside Why can I see it with white eyes
Because it was peaceful for 100 years just by being in the wall
Do not invite them to go out and invite them into the wall
They are children who are interested in the outside world as a policy of the big government I probably made it
I put my life on my mind but it is selfish.
Absolutely no good
No good
That's right You paid for your parents
I do not remember cooperating
How was it
I will not please it
